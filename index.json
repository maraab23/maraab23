In addition to socioeconomic characteristics, having a partner is considered a prerequisite in most fertility studies. Yet, still little is known about the partnership biographies of childless women and men. We assess the heterogeneity in the partnership trajectories of childless persons in Germany and explore compositional differences of partnership trajectories by gender and education. We use data from the German Family Panel to reconstruct partnership biographies reflecting the occurrence and frequency of different partnership states (singleness, living apart together, cohabitation, marriage). The sample comprises women and men born 1971‚Äì1973 whose life courses are observed from age 18‚Äì40. Applying sequence and cluster analysis, we identify five patterns of partnership trajectories: (1) ‚ÄòMarriage‚Äô (14.6%); (2) ‚ÄòLong-term cohabitation‚Äô (11.8%) with one partner; (3) ‚ÄòSerial cohabitation‚Äô (15.6%); (4) ‚ÄòLAT‚Äô (18.8%), long-term/multiple living-apart-together relationships; and (5) ‚ÄòSingle‚Äô (39.3%), long-term singleness. Men are overrepresented in the ‚ÄòSingle‚Äô cluster, especially if highly educated. Women are more often married and more likely to experience long-lasting singleness or multiple LAT episodes when being highly educated. We speculate that theories predicting high levels of childlessness in contexts where gender norms and work-family policies do not account for the increasing gender equality in education and labor force participation might also explain differences in the pathways leading to childlessness. Generally, our findings point at a more elaborate conceptualization of childlessness that moves away from a binary cross-sectional indicator and set the ground for future cross-national comparisons.","tags":[],"title":"The Heterogeneity of Partnership Trajectories to Childlessness in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Based on rich Finnish register data (N = 21,744), the findings show that social origin affects not only final outcomes at given points in the life course but also longitudinal socioeconomic trajectories from ages 17 to 35 in early adulthood. We contribute to previous literature in three ways. First, we show that there is a pronounced similarity in the early socioeconomic trajectories of siblings. This similarity is stronger for same-sex siblings and stronger for brothers than for sisters. Second, we show that sibling similarity in full trajectories cannot be reduced to similarity in outcomes, i.e., siblings are not only more similar in the final outcomes that they obtain but also in the pathways that lead them to these outcomes. Third, our findings support that sibling similarity follows a U-shaped pattern by social class, i.e., similarity is especially strong in disadvantaged trajectories, weak among middle-class young adults, and increases again within the most advantaged trajectories. We conclude that measures of social mobility that concentrate on final outcomes are at risk of underestimating the association between social origin and destination because social inequalities are formed across the life course, not just at the end of specific life phases.","tags":[],"title":"Destination as a Process: Sibling Similarity in Early Socioeconomic Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Raab"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Little is known about how they unfold in tandem in the last years of life. **OBJECTIVE** We take a life-course perspective to identify typical joint trajectories of functional limitations and depression in the last eight years before death. Our objective is to assess whether there is only a linear association between functional limitations and depression or if we also find groups marked by high and increasing functional limitations but low depression, and vice versa. **METHODS** Data from 10 waves of the Health and Retirement Study that cover US Americans who died between 2003-2014 are analyzed with sequence, cluster, and multinomial logistic regression methods. **RESULTS** Results show five typical trajectories of joint functional limitations and depression. Corroborating previous findings, three groups support a linear positive relationship between functional limitations and depression. Beyond previous research, we find two resilient groups of medium and high functional limitations combined with stable low depression. The five groups are highly stratified by social status, gender, marital status, and subjective life expectancy reported at the beginning of the trajectories. **CONCLUSION** Physical and mental health trajectories at the end of life are not only linearly associated. Medium and high functional limitations go along with a polarized pattern of either stable high or stable low depression. **CONTRIBUTION** The nonlinear relationship between functional limitations and depression in the last years of life represented by the 'Resilient' groups of medium and high functional limitations with low depression have gone largely unnoticed in previous research and should be investigated in future studies.","tags":[],"title":"Pathways to death: The co-occurrence of physical and mental health in the last years of life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Raab"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ad19937b8e870413f8d1cb6419ce8945","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/raab2017/2017-01-01_raab2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raab2017/2017-01-01_raab2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigated the association between childhood living arrangements and early family formation in Germany.

We contribute to this literature with a novel research design that combines sibling comparisons and sequence analysis to analyze longitudinal family-formation trajectories of siblings and unrelated persons. This allows us to scrutinize in a more rigorous way whether sibling similarity exists in family-formation trajectories and whether siblings' shared background characteristics, such as parental education and early childhood family structure, can account for similarity in family formation. We use Finnish register data from 1987 through 2007 to construct longitudinal family-formation trajectories in young adulthood for siblings and unrelated dyads (N = 14,257 dyads). Findings show that family formation is moderately but significantly more similar for siblings than for unrelated dyads, also after controlling for crucial parental background characteristics. Shared parental background characteristics add surprisingly little to account for sibling similarity in family formation. Instead, gender and the respondents' own education are more decisive forces in the stratification of family formation. Yet, family internal dynamics seem to reinforce this stratification such that siblings have a higher probability to experience similar family-formation patterns. In particular, patterns that correspond with economic disadvantage are concentrated within families. This is in line with a growing body of research highlighting the importance of family structure in the reproduction of social inequality.","tags":[],"title":"Sibling Similarity in Family Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anette Fasang","Marcel Raab"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1408665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1408665600,"objectID":"2800ac2c6a980c5bfbf1ec715429f973","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/fasang2014/","publishdate":"2014-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fasang2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Research about parental effects on family behavior focuses on intergenerational transmission: that is, whether children show the same family behavior as their parents. This focus potentially overemphasizes similarity and obscures heterogeneity in parental effects on family behavior. In this study, we make two contributions. First, instead of focusing on isolated focal events, we conceptualize parents' and their children's family formation holistically as the process of union formation and childbearing between ages 15 and 40. We then discuss mechanisms likely to shape these intergenerational patterns. Second, beyond estimating average transmission effects, we innovatively apply multichannel sequence analysis to dyadic sequence data on middle-class American families from the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSOG; N = 461 parent-child dyads). The results show three salient intergenerational family formation patterns among this population: a strong transmission, a moderated transmission, and an intergenerational contrast pattern. We examine what determines parents' and children's likelihood to sort into a specific intergenerational pattern. For middle-class American families, educational upward mobility is a strong predictor of moderated intergenerational transmission, whereas close emotional bonds between parents and children foster strong intergenerational transmission. We conclude that intergenerational patterns of family formation are generated at the intersection of macro-structural change and family internal psychological dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Beyond Transmission: Intergenerational Patterns of Family Formation Among Middle-Class American Families","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Leopold","Marcel Raab","Henriette Engelhardt"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"6f64b1fde181118b2826c816278cc048","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/leopold2014/2014-01-01_leopold2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/leopold2014/2014-01-01_leopold2014/","section":"publication","summary":"This research traced the process of caregiver selection among adult children longitudinally, investigating how transitions to parent care were influenced by previous constellations of caregiving costs and commitments within sibling groups.

Among cost-related factors, this transition was predicted primarily by between-sibling differences in previous geographical distances to the parent and, to a lesser extent, competing demands in work and family spheres. The indicators for caregiving commitments showed the importance of reciprocity, path dependency, and parental expectations as motivational forces affecting the process of caregiver selection among adult children.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the linkage between both temporal patterns of reciprocity within an integrative conceptual framework. We assessed whether long-term and short-term reciprocity operated as interdependent mechanisms that initially selected and subsequently relieved intergenerational caregiving relationships. We used data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old study (AHEAD) provided by frail, single-living parents of at least two children (N = 1010 respondents comprising 3768 parent-child dyads). Fixed-effects conditional logit models estimated between-sibling differences in assistance provided to parents, measured by instrumental help (i.e., assistance with IADLs) and hands-on care (i.e., assistance with ADLs). Key predictors were two measures of financial transfers given to children referring to longer and shorter recall periods. Receiving earlier and current financial transfers increased adult children's propensity to support their parents in later life. The effect of earlier transfers pertained to help rather than care whereas the reverse was true for the effect of current transfers. We found no evidence for a linkage between long-term and short-term reciprocity. Overall, the results indicate that adult children might balance long-term support accounts relative to their siblings, suggesting an intra-generational orientation on equity..","tags":[],"title":"The temporal structure of intergenerational exchange: A within-family analysis of parent-child reciprocity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Zielonka","Jan Skopek","Marcel Raab"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"b6b2a9340559fc6e73ba95ba331d5faa","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/zielonka2012/2012-01-01_zielonka2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zielonka2012/2012-01-01_zielonka2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"NEPS Data Manual.

We argue that reciprocity in parent‚Äêchild relationships also operates in the short term. Our analysis of short‚Äêterm reciprocity focuses on concurrent exchange in its main upward and downward currencies, time and money. Fixed‚Äêeffects models with data from SHARE (N = 8,816 dyads) revealed that within a family, parents gave financial transfers to those children who supported them with time transfers of help and care. Reciprocal patterns emerged most clearly if parents were highly dependent, received intense support, and had sufficient financial opportunities to reciprocate. We conclude that short‚Äêterm reciprocity eases the burden of late parent‚Äêchild relationships.","tags":[],"title":"Short-Term Reciprocity in Late Parent-Child Relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Ruland","Marcel Raab","Benno Sch√∂nberger","Hans-Peter Blossfeld","Dirk Hof√§cker","Sandra Buchholz","Paul Schmelzer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"a1013b01582d4aa371e66f32babfe09d","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/ruland2009/2009-01-01_ruland2009/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ruland2009/2009-01-01_ruland2009/","section":"publication","summary":"Globalization definitely has been one of the most discussed issues in social sciences during the last decade, and still is today. Despite this grown interest, the measurement of globalization still remains vague or often one-sidedly restricted to the analysis of its economic dimension, thereby neglecting the multidimensionality of the phenomenon of globalization. As a consequence, a differentiated measure of globalization covering both economic and social aspects that can be, for example, introduced into multivariate analysis of survey data as an explanatory variable, is still largely missing. In this article, we suggest a multi-dimensional globalization measure, encompassing economic, (socio-)technological, cultural, and political dimensions of global change. It builds on previous globalization measures, but extends them by additional dimensions and indicators representing central facets of a genuine sociological concept of globalization. Our contribution starts by shortly describing the multidimensional nature of the globalization process and then develops an overall sociological index of globalization, which we call Global- Index, covering a total of 97 different countries from 1970 to 2002. Based on this measure, we first describe the development of globalization on a worldwide scale and across economic regions. Next, we demonstrate the potential of the GlobalIndex for the analysis of contemporary survey data by illustratively including it into two micro-level longitudinal analyses of labor market transitions during the early career in Germany and the United Kingdom.","tags":[],"title":"GlobalIndex - Ein soziologischer Ansatz zur Messung von Globalisierung","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hans-Peter Blossfeld","Dirk Hof√§cker","Marcel Raab","Michael Ruland","Sandra Buchholz"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"bf26b55f02e550bacf59c402a15a2994","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/blossfeld2009/2009-01-01_blossfeld2009/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blossfeld2009/2009-01-01_blossfeld2009/","section":"publication","summary":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","tags":[],"title":"Globalisierungsprozesse in modernen Gesellschaften","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Raab","Michael Ruland","Benno Sch√∂nberger","Hans-Peter Blossfeld","Dirk Hof√§cker","Sandra Buchholz","Paul Schmelzer"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\rsection {\rbackground: white;\rcolor: black;\rborder-radius: 1em;\rpadding: 1em;\rleft: 50% }\r#inner {\rdisplay: inline-block;\rdisplay: flex;\ralign-items: center;\rjustify-content: center }\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"8cf13c9ae66e3fbd751cea4365ee9b83","permalink":"https://marcelraab.de/publication/raab2008/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raab2008/","section":"publication","summary":"This article suggests a multidimensional globalization measure, encompassing economic, (socio)technological, cultural and political dimensions of global change.
